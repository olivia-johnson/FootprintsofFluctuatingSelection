# Discerning the Genetic Footprints of Seasonal Fluctuating Selection: A Comparison with Established Selection Forms

This repository contains the code to replicate the analysis conducted in the aforementioned article. 

The [yaml](sim_env.yml) file can be used to create a conda environment with the programs required to conduct the simulations and analysis performed in this study.

Once cloning the repository, the environment can be created using the following code

```ruby
conda env create -f sim_env.yml

conda activate sim_env
```

A parameter file is used to pass values to simulations. An [example file](parameter_example.txt) can be used as a template with the text in quotations removed.
